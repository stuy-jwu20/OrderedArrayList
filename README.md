OrderedArrayList

Summary of Discussions/Questions Asked:

Talked about having generics in the file names if they're in two
different classes.
  E.g. (Should "Holder<T>" be the filename or just "Holder"?)
  We said it should just probably be "Holder".

How to override method?
  We said that the method and arguments should be the same, just with slightly modified things so it outputs what we want.

Asked if we needed to import ArrayList or we make our own class for it.
  We said it should make sense to import it and not make it from the ground up again...

Asked on how we should get started on NoNullArrayList.
  After writing the header, we said to start overriding methods.

Someone shared their screen and we helped him on getting started and they asked if we need a private variable.
